# react-native-test

## Getting Started

1. clone repo and create a file named firebaseUrl.js in the root directory
2. Inside firebaseUrl.js
 ``` export default "https://<YOUR_FIREBASE_URL/"; ```

## The Stack
 1. Immutable.js
 2. Redux
 3. Firebase
 4. React Native

## Todo:
* ~~Add has-many relationship with firebase (Todo has  many Notes)~~
* Reduce BoilerPlate For Redux Actions. Convetions over config.
* Swipe Events
* Add base styles
* Add Android Build
* **CLEAN UP**  Not in a very good state atm. Need to clean up code and move to react-native-boiler-plate
